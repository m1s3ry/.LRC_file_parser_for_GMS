# .LRC_file_parser_for_GMS
A GMS 2.3 file parser for .LRC (Lyric files)

###

A .LRC file is a file containing the lyrics of a song with timestamps, pretty much like .SRT files for a movie.
Maybe you are making a game with an emphasis on music (i.e. a rythm game) and you want the lyrics of the song to be displayed accurately while the song is playing.
Well, maybe then you'll appreciate this :D

Just include the .lrc file/s in your GMS project and be done with it. The code is *very slighty* commented, so if you have any doubt of how this works, just ask away.

## License
This asset is free to use. Credits are not required but appreciated nonetheless. Also, I want to see any project using this and seeing some creative uses

## Known Problems
* It will probably not work with files that have over an hour of timestamp
* It's only for GMS v2.3 (it was created with IDE v23.1.1.408)
